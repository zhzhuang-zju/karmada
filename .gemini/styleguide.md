**Purpose:** This document outlines the specific code style and quality rules for the Karmada project. When reviewing code or generating PR descriptions, Gemini should enforce these rules to ensure consistency and maintainability.

> **Note:** These rules supplement the official Go style guide. Where this guide is silent, standard Go best practices apply.

You can get the code style guide in https://karmada.io/docs/developers/code-style-guide.
